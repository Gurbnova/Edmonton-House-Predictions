# Edmonton-House-Predictions
A website that predicts house prices in Edmonton based on a set of factors. Model trained on a 2022 Edmonton house prices dataset

This repository contains a modified version of a house price prediction project originally based on a tutorial. This project demonstrates my work and learning process, incorporating various improvements and adaptations.

## Original Tutorial

- **Tutorial URL:** [Open Source Tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu7clOTtwsp94PcHbzqpAdg)

- **My Contributions:** The modifications and original code I have added are licensed under the [ Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE).

## Modifications and Improvements

1. **Dataset Adaptation:**
   - Adapted the project to work with the Edmonton House Price dataset instead of the Bangladesh dataset. This required adjustments in data preprocessing and feature engineering to suit the new dataset.

2. **Data Cleaning and Processing:**
   - Implemented custom data cleaning methods to address the specifics of the Edmonton dataset.
   - Updated data preprocessing steps to handle differences between the datasets effectively.

3. **Library Updates:**
   - Modified the code to be compatible with newer versions of `scikit-learn` and `pickle` libraries.
   - Ensured compatibility with recent updates in libraries and frameworks.

4. **Enhanced Usability:**
   - Made the project compatible with both Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook, enhancing its portability and usability across different environments.

5. **User Interface Improvements:**
   - Implemented a new user interface to make the application more presentable and user-friendly.
